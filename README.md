# MultithreadingWithLocks

Objectives Assessed:

- Apply parallel and distributed computing to computational problems and analyze the scalability and efficiency of the solutions.

- Apply Python towards several contemporary programming requirements and techniques involving secure, distributed, and parallel computing  

- Implement multithreading with the use of Locks


This module covers two common models for concurrency, namely, shared memory and message passing.
In addition properly implementing shared memory is covered. This includes race conditions, critical section,
mutual exclusion, deadlock, starvation, semaphore, monitors, and condition variables. In addition, using the Thread Objects in python using semaphore, monitors, and condition variables is covered.
